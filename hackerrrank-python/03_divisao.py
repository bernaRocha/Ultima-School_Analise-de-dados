'''
Task
The provided code stub reads two integers, a and b, from STDIN.

Add logic to print two lines. The first line should contain the result of integer division,
a // b. The second line should contain the result of float division, a / b.

No rounding or formatting is necessary.

Example a = 3, b = 5
The result of the integer division 3 //5 = 0. 
The result of the float division is 3 / 5 = 0.6
